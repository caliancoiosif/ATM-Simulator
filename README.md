What Is an Automated Teller Machine (ATM)?
An automated teller machine (ATM) is an electronic banking outlet that allows customers to complete basic transactions without the aid of a branch representative or teller. Anyone with a credit card or debit card can access cash at most ATMs.


ATMs are convenient, allowing consumers to perform quick self-service transactions such as deposits, cash withdrawals, bill payments, and transfers between accounts. Fees are commonly charged for cash withdrawals by the bank where the account is located, by the operator of the ATM, or by both. Some or all of these fees can be avoided by using an ATM operated directly by the bank that holds the account.


ATMs are known in different parts of the world as automated bank machines (ABM) or cash machines.

Understanding Automated Teller Machines (ATMs)
The first ATM appeared at a branch of Barclay's Bank in London in 1967, although there are reports of a cash dispenser in use in Japan in the mid-1960s. The interbank communications networks that allowed a consumer to use one bank's card at another bank's ATM came later, in the 1970s.

Within a few years, ATMs had spread around the globe, securing a presence in every major country. They now can be found even in tiny island nations such as Kiribati and the Federated States of Micronesia.

There are now more than 3.5 million ATMs in use across the world.
